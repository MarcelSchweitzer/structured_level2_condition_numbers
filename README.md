# structured_level2_condition_numbers
Code to reproduce the experiments in [B. Arslan, S. D. Relton, M. Schweitzer, *Structured level-2 condition numbers of matrix functions*, 2023, arXiv:2304.14077]

For each experiment, run the script `run_experiment_4_X.m` in order to reproduce the figures from the paper. 

***Caution:*** The MATLAB codes in this repository are not optimized for speed, but rather to give robust results in order to illustrate and confirm the developed theory. Run times are therefore quite large.
